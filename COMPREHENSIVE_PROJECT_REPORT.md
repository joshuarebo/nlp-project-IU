### 2.2 Data Ingestion & Quality Assessment

**Original Dataset Statistics:**
- **Total Records**: 555,957 complaints
- **Key Field**: `consumer_complaint_narrative` (target text)
- **Data Quality Issues**: Missing narratives, duplicates, length variations

**Quality Control Pipeline:**
```python
# Sample filtering logic
def check_text_quality(tokens):
    if len(tokens) < 8:  # Too short
        return False
    unique_ratio = len(set(tokens)) / len(tokens)
    return unique_ratio > 0.3  # At least 30% unique words
```

**Post-Filtering Statistics:**
- **Final Dataset**: 47,967 complaints (8.6% of original)
- **Average Length**: 127.4 tokens per complaint
- **Quality Threshold**: Minimum 8 tokens, 30% unique word ratio

### 2.3 Advanced Text Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline implements multiple sophisticated techniques:

#### 2.3.1 Text Cleaning
```python
def clean_text(text):
    # Remove financial identifiers (XXXX patterns)
    text = re.sub(r'\bXX+\b', '', text)
    # Remove dates and numbers
    text = re.sub(r'\b\d{1,2}[\/\-]\d{1,2}[\/\-]\d{2,4}\b', '', text)
    # Remove URLs and special patterns
    text = re.sub(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+])+', '', text)
    return text
```

#### 2.3.2 Domain-Specific Stopword Extension
